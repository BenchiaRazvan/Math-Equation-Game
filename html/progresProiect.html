                    The project was developed in the first half of the time allocated by 3 students (Benchia Razvan, Agachi Eusebiu and Dobrovici Cristian), and in the second half of the time allocated to be continued only by 2 students (Benchia Razvan and Agachi Eusebiu).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Github was used as a file management system, acting as a history of each member's participation in the project. Each file has been added to the appropriate folder (html, images, css, etc.) for better file management.
                    When a team member completes the task assigned to him, he commits from Github Desktop to the main project. In this way, you can see the work of each member in the task he has just completed.
                    As for the details brought on the project, they were brought by Benchia Razvan, the other members dealing with the popularity of the other windows with the details just brought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first weeks of the project (5-8) the team took care of the design of the application, mocking the main windows. We also tried as much as possible to implement a responsive design for those windows. A mandatory requirement of the project was to have a valid html / css code, which we covered.
                </p>
                <figure typeof="sa:image" id="progres-1">
                    <img src="../images/progres1.png" style="width:200px;height:500px;" alt="navbar-screenshot" class="screenshots-nav" />
                </figure>
                <p>
                    In the following weeks, until the deadline, the team coordinator was Benchia Razvan. He implements certain technologies on certain windows, which Agachi Eusebius scales on the other windows. Also, in the second half of the project, technologies such as Ajax, PHP were used. The admin window has also been implemented, where the administrator can add problems to the database, which he can display in the main application. The buttons have been stylized in such a way as to be usable, with a definite role.
                    As can be seen on the commits, the first to implement a technology was Benchia Razvan, after which Agachi Eusebiu took that technology and applied it on the remaining windows.
                </p>
                <figure typeof="sa:image" id="progres-2">
                    <img src="../images/progres2.png" style="width:200px;height:500px;" alt="navbar-screenshot" class="screenshots-nav" />
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Finally, the remaining team of two people took care of creating the new documentation, updating the old ones, and retouching the final details.
