                <h3 id="product-perspective">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
                <p>
                    This product is presented as a new product, autonomous, but still similar to sites for others fields (computer science, biology etc.). It shares the same ideas with many other sites, but for the fields of mathematics.
                </p>

                <h3 id="product-functions">2.2 Product Functions</h3>

                    <li>Math problem solving</li>
                    <li>Registration in the application</li>

                </ul>

                <h3 id="users">2.3 Uses Classes and Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                    We believe that the class of users who will use this application will be mainly composed of students from primary school, middle school and high school. They can solve interactive problems, being rewarded for each problem solved correctly with virtual coins.
                </p>

                <h3 id="operating-environment">2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    For optimal use of the application, version 1.0, we recommend using the Mozilla Firefox browser (other browsers may not display properly). Also, there is no need for top hardware specifications - due to the simplicity of the application, we believe that it can run on the vast majority of computers.
                </p>

                <h3 id="constraints">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
                <p>
                    For the web application interface, Math Equation Game, we used only HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Ajax. Instead, to create the backend we will mainly use PHP. The developer is constrained by the fact that presenting problems to the client requires the use of the MathML utility. This utility contains certain "components" that do not display to customer information correctly, so little tricks have been used.

                </p>

                <h3 id="documentantion">2.6 User Documentation</h3>
                <p>
                    In order for the web application to work in optimal parameters, it is necessary to use the Firefox browser. The MathML format is not supported by some browsers, and for this reason, it is recommended to use the Firefox browser.
                </p>

                <h3 id="dependencies">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
                <p>
                    The part of the database in which users' information is stored may affect the utility of the application (for example, if the database service requires a fee, depending on the complexity, changes will be made to the application).

                <h4>3.1.1 Home Interface</h4>
                <p>
                    The image below is the main window, in which the user will enter to authenticate or register. The user has at his disposal a navigation bar, through which he can access the contact page, he can access the proposed problem categories or he can search for information in the application. Also, by using the "login" button, the user will be sent to the page intended for authentication, and by using the "register" button, the user will be sent to the page intended for registration in the application.

                    A first software component that establishes a connection with the application is the database. To access the database, the PHP language is used, and to modify the data inside the database, MySQL is used. The application also uses the MathType utility suite, which allows the correct formatting and the correct display of problems in the form of MathML. The application administrator enters the desired equation in the MathType utility, and through certain commands, the utility returns the equation in MathML form, which will be entered in the HTML file, for a correct display of the equation for the user. Also, scripts written in JavaScript language are used to improve the user experience in the application.

                <h3 id="communications-interface">3.4 Communications Interfaces</h3>
                <p>
                    The application imposes the condition that the user has an internet connection, in order to be able to verify the answers given by him. Also, the internet connection is necessary regarding the contact with the application developers, in the contact window. Another protocol that is used within the application (on the server side) is the HTTP protocol.

                <p>
                    This feature has a high priority because it is the main feature of the application. In addition to the other features, the main purpose of the application is to solve, in an interactive way, math problems in different categories. Problems are considered solved if the user enters the correct answer of the problem in the field intended for the answer.

                <h3 id="system-features-2">4.2 System Feature 2: Participation in the Top</h3>
                <p>
                    This feature has a medium priority, because the top helps users to be recognized in the application, but they have no reward (both in the application and outside it). Ranking in a place as high as possible in the ranking highlights the user as being diligent and determined to understand the techniques for solving the problems described in the application.

                <h3 id="safety">5.2 Safety Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    The results of testing the application in the current version (1.0) showed that there are no losses, damages or losses that may occur from the use of the application. However, if a violation of one of the above is observed, it is recommended to isolate and analyze the incident.

                <h3 id="security">5.3 Security Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    The database used is MySQL, and each user's data is stored in the database. Each user's password is not stored properly, but is applied to a hash, after which it is concatenated with another random string. The final result is stored in the database. Through certain functions that cannot be revealed publicly, each user logs in to his password.

                <h3 id="software">5.4 Software Quality Attributes</h3>
                <p>
                    The application has as secondary purpose reliability, but also portability on different devices (computer, tablet, phone). This work is done with the help of the responsive interface, but also with the periodic care of the application by the developers. If a significant improvement is needed then a new patch appears, in the form of a version.
